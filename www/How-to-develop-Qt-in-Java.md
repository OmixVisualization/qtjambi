# How To Develop With QtJambi

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.qtjambi/qtjambi/badge.svg)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.qtjambi/qtjambi)

Add **qtjambi.jar** to the classpath of your Java project containing the most 
essential Qt Core, Gui and Widgets modules. If you use Maven to build your application simply add following dependency
to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.qtjambi</groupId>
  <artifactId>qtjambi</artifactId>
  <version>$VERSION</version>
</dependency>
```
(exchange `$VERSION` either by `5.15.14`, `6.2.12` or by `6.4.4`).

Otherwise, download QtJambi JAR file from [Maven Central Repository](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.qtjambi/qtjambi/).
Find the [list of all available QtJambi modules](www/Modules.md).

## Example Program

Create a file **Test.java** containing the following code

``` java
import io.qt.widgets.*;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        QApplication.initialize(args);
        QMessageBox.information(null, "QtJambi", "Hello World!");
        QApplication.shutdown();
    }
}
```

Compile the file:

``` powershell
javac -cp qtjambi-6.4.4.jar Test.java
```

## Executing Example

For execution you need the platform dependent binaries of *QtJambi*. For
instance, if you are working on Windows download the *windows-x64*
binaries. Additionally, you need *Qt*. Use the [Qt
installer](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer) to install Qt on
your system. Make sure you are using the same Qt version and QtJambi
version (e.g. 5.15 or 6.3). On Linux, you can alternatively use Qt system libraries (correct version provided).
The required DLLs are to be found in the `bin` folder on Windows and `lib` folder on Linux and macOS, respectively. 

When running a QtJambi application you have to make the locations of Qt
and QtJambi libraries known to Java. Therefore, use the **PATH**
environment (**LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH** on Linux, **DYLD\_FRAMEWORK\_PATH** on
macOS) or the Java runtime property **java.library.path**.

The example program can be executed this way on Windows:

``` powershell
java -cp qtjambi-6.4.4.jar;qtjambi-native-windows-x64-6.4.4.jar;. -Djava.library.path=C:\Qt\6.4.3\msvc2019_64\bin Test
```

On Linux it looks this way:

``` bash
java -cp qtjambi-6.4.4.jar:qtjambi-native-linux-x64-6.4.4.jar:. -Djava.library.path=<path to>/Qt/6.4.3/gcc_64/lib Test
```

On macOS you additionally need to use the start parameter -XstartOnFirstThread:

``` bash
java -cp qtjambi-6.4.4.jar:qtjambi-native-macos-6.4.4.jar:. -Djava.library.path=<path to>/Qt/6.4.3/macos/lib -XstartOnFirstThread Test
```

### Native Components

QtJambi automatically detects the required native component jars if they are located next to their Java counterparts.
You can simply skip `qtjambi-native-OS-VERSION.jar` in your classpath (`-cp`). Nevertheless, `qtjambi-native-OS-VERSION.jar` bundles are
extracted every time at program startup. By default, this is a process specific temporal directory purged after program shutdown.
Alternatively, you can use Java system property `io.qt.deploymentdir` to let libraries to be exctacted and persist in user 
application data path or common directory ([see below](#library-management)).

## Further Reading

In general, you can start learning how to use Qt in Java [as it is
introduced for
C++](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/gettingstarted.html#create-your-first-applications).
There are a couple of specifics for QtJambi that are [introduced
here](Characteristics-of-QtJambi.md). Instead of starting your
program with a java command as shown above you can deploy your
application as executable [as described
here](How-to-deploy-QtJambi-applications.md).
[Read here](www/How-to-bundle-Qt-libraries.md) about creating self-exctracting bundles containing Qt library.

## Useful Java System Properties for QtJambi

Following system properties are accepted by QtJambi.
You can specify Java system properties as start argument `-Dproperty=value` or in Java code `System.setProperty("property", "value")`.

### Message Handling

* `io.qt.log-messages` - By specifying any combination of `ALL`, `CRITICAL`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `FATAL`, `INFO` and `SYSTEM` you can install a message handler causing exceptions to be thrown in the event of a message of given type.
* `io.qt.exceptions-for-messages` - By specifying any combination of `ALL`, `CRITICAL`, `DEBUG`, `WARNING`, `FATAL`, `INFO` and `SYSTEM` you can install a message handler forwarding messages of given types to Java logging.

### Library Management

* `io.qt.library-path-override` - Use this property if you want to force Java to load Qt and QtJambi libraries from other paths than given by `java.library.path`.
* `io.qt.debug` - Specify `debug` to force Java using debug libraries of Qt and QtJambi.
* `io.qt.verbose-loading` - Specify `true` to cause QtJambi to print out library loading steps.
* `io.qt.pluginpath` - Specify list of paths added as plugin search path.

If you native library bundles QtJambi extracts these components to temporary directory each time at program startup. Typically, it is a process specific directory purged at program termination.

* `io.qt.keep-temp-deployment` - Specify `true` to avoid library deletion at program termination. The libraries remain in temporary directory instead.
* `io.qt.deploymentdir` - Specify `user` to let QtJambi extract libraries to user's application data directory. Specify `common` to let them be extracted to common program data directory. Specify a target directory to let them be extracted there.
* `io.qt.no-native-deployment` - Specify `true` if you want to inhibit the search for native library bundles at all and load QtJambi from library path instead.

### QtJambi Runtime

* `io.qt.allow-nonfinal-signals` - Specify `true` to avoid exception to be thrown when detecting non-final signal declarations.
* `io.qt.no-library-shutdown-hook` - Specify `true` to avoid library shutdown at program termination.
* `io.qt.disable-thread-affinity-check` - Specify `true` to avoid thread affinity checks when accessing `QObject`s. Use this property to improve performance in release versions of your well tested applications.
* `io.qt.disable-event-thread-affinity-check` - ...the same applying to access checks during event handling.
* `io.qt.no-app-deletion` - Specify `true` if you combine native code with Java code and your `QCoreApplication` instance has been created elsewhere than inside Java.

### QML

* `io.qt.enabled-qml-debugging` - Specify `true` to allow QML debugging for the entire runtime of the application.
* `io.qt.enabled-qml-debugging-nowarn` - ...also inhibits a security warning.

Along with this use program argument `-qmljsdebugger=...` to enable QML debugging for Qt.
