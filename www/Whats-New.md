# What's new in QtJambi 6.8.1

## Bugfixes

Solved issue:
* [Issue 211](../../../issues/211): Building QtJambi 6.8.0 from sources fails on Kubuntu 24.10
* [Issue 214](../../../issues/214): QtJambi 6.8.1 RC1 does not build from sources against Qt 6.8.1
* Fixed: Crashes in QML due to forwarded Java exceptions
* Fixed: Crash on macOS when using application-wide event filter and QtWebEngine

## New Feature

* New JVM option `io.qt.no-exception-forwarding-from-meta-calls` to avoid `QMetaObject` calls (like method invocation and property access) forwarding exceptions to the Qt caller in any case (it is avoided by default in case of Qml-related QObjects).
* `QtUtilities::setNoExceptionForwardingFromMetaCallsEnabled(boolean)` enable/disable avoiding exception forwarding from meta calls.
* New JVM option `io.qt.no-exception-forwarding-from-virtual-calls` to avoid virtual calls (i.e. Java overrides) forwarding exceptions to the Qt caller in any case.
* `QtUtilities::setNoExceptionForwardingFromVirtualCallsEnabled(boolean)` enable/disable avoiding exception forwarding from virtual calls.
* New JVM option `io.qt.enable-signal-emit-thread-check` to activate thread checks on signal emits. If a signal is emitted from a foreign thread a warning is given. Install custom handler with `QtUtilities.installSignalEmitThreadCheckHandler` to change this behavior.
* `QtUtilities::setSignalEmitThreadCheckEnabled(boolean)` enable/disable thread checks at signal emit.
* `QtUtilities::installSignalEmitThreadCheckHandler(BiConsumer<QObject,AbstractSignal>)` Install a handler for signal emit thread checks to be is executed every time an event is emitted from a foreign thread.
* `QObject::connect`, `Signal::connect`, `QTimer::singleShot` as well as `QMetaObject::invokeMethod` now accept class method handles, e.g. `QMetaObject::invokeMethod(widget, QWidget::setVisible, true);`
* Performance improvements on `QMetaObject::invokeMethod`.
* More flexibility for selective event filters: class type filtering, object name filtering (string comparison or regular expression match). Moved from `QtUtilities` to `QCoreApplication`.
* `QAbstractFileEngineHandler` can be created from file name tests (string comparison or regular expression match). This avoids Java calls for every single file operation.
* QtJambi is now shipped with native binaries for Linux arm64 (6.8 and higher).
* Added API method: `QRandomGenerator::bounded`, `QAbstractHttpServer::addWebSocketUpgradeVerifier`
* Added API types: `QSemaphoreReleaser`, `QReadLocker`, `QWriteLocker` and `QMutexLocker` to be used in try-with-resources

## Deprecated

* `QtUtilities.asSelectiveEventFilter(eventFilter, eventType...)` now deprecated. Use `QCoreApplication.asSelectiveEventFilter` instead.

QtJambi 6.8.1 is not binary-compatible to Qt 6.8.0.  Please use Qt 6.8.1 or higher.

QtJambi 6.7.3 is not binary-compatible to Qt 6.7.0. Please use Qt 6.7.1 or higher.
QtJambi 6.8.0 is not binary-compatible to Qt 6.8.1.

## What's new in QtJambi 6.7.2

#### Bugfixes

Solved issue:
* Exception when emitting `QAbstractItemModel.dataChanged` with default arguments
* Auto-detected invokable method in subclass shadowing superclass property
* Signal connections to lambda expression fail on queued emit
* Type registration of `QMetaType(QAbstractItemModel\*)` incomplete when implicitly done during subclass registration
* Running on Android again

#### New Feature

* New nullness support in `QVariant`:
	* `QVariant.fromValue()` with argument `null` now converts to `QVariant(Nullptr)` (`QVariant.setValue()` similar)
	* `QVariant.NULL` is an alias object represents `QVariant(Nullptr)`
	* `QVariant.nullable(Object)` returns the given object if not `null` and `QVariant.NULL` otherwise
	* `QVariant.typedNullable<T>(Object,Class,QMetaType...)` returns the given object if not `null` and a type-specific null alias object otherwise
* New experimental features to be enabled by JVM argument `-D<prop>=true` or via `System.setProperty("<prop>", "true")`:
	* `io.qt.experimental.fast-jni` enables improved gathering of JNI environment during native calls
	* `io.qt.experimental.fast-jni-for-overrides` enables improved gathering of JNI environment during native virtual calls
	* Following experimental features deal with the improvement of item model performance:
		* `io.qt.experimental.item-model-cached-virtuals` item model's `rowCount()` and `columnCount()` return values are cached to improve performance of item views.
		* `io.qt.experimental.enable-invalid-modelindex-singleton` invalid `QModelIndex` is represented by one single Java object.
		* `io.qt.experimental.enable-ephemeral-modelindexes` instead of calling virtual Java methods with a copy of a QModelIndex argument it submits an alias which is invalidated after use.

#### Further Changes

* QPropertyAlias is deprecated

QtJambi 6.7.2 is not binary-compatible to Qt 6.7.0. Please use Qt 6.7.1 or higher.

## What's new in QtJambi 6.7.1

#### Bugfixes

Solved issue:
* switch over extensible enum
* using `QObject::eventFilter` on dying objects
* bugfix related to missing RTTI in libraries on macOS
* [Issue 197](../../../issues/197): Meta object does not take public field if getter and setter are available
* [Issue 199](../../../issues/199): `QTextCursor` is doing a dangling pointer check on `QTextDocument` before GCed to avoid crashes
* QML: Initializing lightweight Java types with QML null without crash
* `QObject::destructed` signal now sending proxy instance for GCed objects

#### New Feature

* You can now declare a signal to be lightweight by using `@QtUninvokable` annotation. Such a signal is not implemented by Qt's meta object system but purely in Java. 
* `QtUtilities.asSelectiveEventFilter(eventFilter, eventType...)` now allows you to produce an event filter only for selected event types. This saves native-to-java conversion for irrelevant cases.
* support of `std::unique_ptr` in Qt API
* Class `QChar` giving static access to Qt's character API
* JVM argument `io.qt.enable-cleanup-logs=true` allows you to print all cleanup operations after Java objects are GCed ([Issue 199](../../../issues/199))

#### Further Changes

* Performance improvements for thread-affine deletions (e.g. GC deleting a `QPersistentModelIndex`)
* Adding `@since` information to Java Docs.
* Extra signals of internal QObject's without API representation now support cloned signals (signals with default arguments).

QtJambi 6.7.1 is not binary-compatible to Qt 6.7.0. Please use Qt 6.7.1 or higher.

## What's new in QtJambi 6.7.0

#### Bugfixes

Solved issue:

* Bugfix in handling lightweight Java types in Qt containers
* Bugfix in deployer
* `QObject.findChild` now having the correct return type
* Meta object auto-detection now skips methods if property of same name is also available. This led to access errors in QML/JavaScript.
* Improved the API of several `QDBusArgument` extraction methods.

#### Further Changes

* Improved error message when trying to use QtJambi with mismatching Qt build
* Improvement of `QMetaObject.invokeMethod` implementation.
* Providing `QMetaObject.writeProperty` and readProperty doing thread-affine access to `QProperty`.

This will be the last release with Maven-published binaries for Qt 5.15 and Qt 6.6.

## What's new in QtJambi 6.6.2

#### Bugfixes

Solved issue:
* [Issue 185](../../../issues/185): QtJambi build from scratch on windows has missing opengl classes
* Java-written `QObject`s wrapped as native `QVariant` can be now used in Qml/JavaScript.

#### Further Changes

* QtJambi's build system is now able to run on Windows arm64 and FreeBSD.
* Java-based QML plugins now survive a reset by `qmlClearTypeRegistrations()` without crash

* binary compatibility to Qt 6.6.2
* ready for Qt 6.7

## What's new in QtJambi 6.6.1

#### Bugfixes

Solved issue:
* [Issue 168](../../../issues/168): QtJambi does not build from sources using JDK 21 - further improvements

Blindfix for issue:
* [Issue 184](../../../issues/184): QtJambi 6.6.0 seems to not update cache of Java resources accessible via Qt?

#### Further Changes

* `std::chrono` types now map to `java.time` classes.
* New class `QScope` to manage resources in a try-with-resources block.
* QtJambi API changes its type mapping of data pointers from arrays to NIO buffers. This is especially relevant for virtual functions like `QIODevice::readData`, `QIODevice::writeData` and similar methods. They are now buffer-based. The former array-based API is available as final delegate functions. Subclasses of  `QIODevice`, `QAbstractFileEngine` and `QPicture` implementing read/write need to be changed to using buffers instead.
* The native pointer corresponds to a NIO buffer's position.
* Java arrays can be specified with offset and length parameter to be translated to native pointer and length.
* QtJambi API now provides function overloads for all possibles calls according to implicit constructors of argument types. For legacy code, this may lead to ambiguous situations when using `null` as argument.
* Automatic download of Android SDK/NDK during the build process
* Made some array arguments of `QPaintEngine` and `QPainter`'s draw functions vararg.

## What's new in QtJambi 6.2.1 / 5.15.3

#Versioning

Since there are multiple releases of QtJambi for the same Qt version and since QtJambi is now available on Maven, 
it is necessary to use more specific version numbers for different QtJambi releases.

From now on, QtJambi builds have the major and minor version of their assigned Qt versions (e.g. 6.2) 
and an increasing patch version counting the number of releases.
Since QtJambi for Qt 5.15 was published three times up to now, the current forth QtJambi release is 5.15.3. QtJambi for Qt6.2 is release number 6.2.1. 
The first QtJambi for Qt 6.3 will be versioned 6.3.0.

QtJambi 5.15.3 works with any patch version of Qt 5.15 and, accordingly, QtJambi 6.2.1 works with any patch version of Qt 6.2.

## Support for Platform Integration Native Interfaces on Qt6

`QCoreApplication`, `QWindow` and other components now give access to their platform integration on macOS, Windows and X11. Example:

``` java
QWindow window = ...
QWindowsWindow windowsWindow = window.nativeInterface(QWindowsWindow.class);
QCocoaWindow macWindow = window.nativeInterface(QCocoaWindow.class);
QXcbWindow x11Window = window.nativeInterface(QXcbWindow.class);
```

## Overloaded Signals

Implementing overloaded signals is simplyfied and can now be done even outside of QObjects. Therefore, subclass `QObject.MultiSignal`, 
`QInstanceMemberSignals.MultiSignal` or `QStaticMemberSignals.MultiSignal` and add custom overloaded emit methods. 
The underlying signal structure is generated automatically.

Beside this, you can connect to overloaded signals without specifying its parameters by `overload(Class)`.
The intended parameterized signal is determined in accordance with the slot's parameters. Example:

``` java
QCompleter completer = ...
completer.activated.connect(receiver, "onActivatedIndex(QModelIndex)");
completer.activated.connect(receiver, "onActivatedText(String)");
completer.activated.connect(receiver::onActivatedIndex);
completer.activated.connect(receiver::onActivatedText);
```

## Performance Improvements

Signal initialization is improved bringing better performance for object initialization.

## Bugfixes

A lot!

## Compatibility

QtJambi 6.2.1 and 5.15.3 are source-compatible but maybe not be binary-compatible to its predecessor releases. 
You might need to compile your code with the new QtJambi version again.
