# QtJambi - Java Bindings for Qt

## Overview

QtJambi is Qt bindings for the Java programming language originally developed by Trolltech, the predecessor of The Qt Company. 
The successive open source project provides bindings of Qt5 and Qt6 releases for latest Java JDK versions.

QtJambi makes the entire Qt framework available in Java or Kotlin.

The bindings are generated by inspection of the C++ header files of the Qt implementation then emitting code to provide the 
necessary JNI (Java Native Interface) and .java files to provide linkage to Java. An application programmer using QtJambi 
would simply add the corresponding Java libraries (.jar files) to their Java project to be able to develop and deploy their application.

## Availability

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/io.qtjambi/qtjambi/badge.svg)](https://search.maven.org/artifact/io.qtjambi/qtjambi)
[![Release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/OmixVisualization/qtjambi)](https://github.com/OmixVisualization/qtjambi/releases)

QtJambi is available for Java 8 or 11 and higher using Qt5.15 and Qt6 in Java on Windows, Android Linux and macOS. 
Most Qt modules are available as QtJambi module as [listed here](www/Modules.md). All modules are published as Maven Artifact.

**The native components for Windows available on Maven require Qt binaries for MSVC (msvc2022_64). Mingw Qt is not compatible with QtJambi unless you build it from scratch with Mingw.**

**By default, the native components of only essential modules are made available on Maven. Please make a request via [/issues](Issues) if you require native components not yet available.**

## Support

QtJambi is an open source project making the power of Qt available for your Java projects free of charge. However, this project is causing ongoing costs. 
Please consider supporting this project by donation. Your support is highly appreciated.
